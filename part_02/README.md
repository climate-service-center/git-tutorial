# Part 2 - Working together

Everybody should be setup and comfortable with creating their own repositories on github and gitlab and make commits. In part 2, we want to actually work together
on a repository.

## Tasks

* Fork the main repository for this tutorial.
* `git pull` the fork to your local computer.
* Create a branch using `git branch -b`.
* Check using `git status`.
* Add a feature, e.g., add a source code file or change an existing one.
* Commit your changes using `git commit`
* Push your changes to a remote branch in your fork using `git push`.
* Create a pull request on github and write a nice message to the maintainers.
