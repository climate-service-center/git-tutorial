# Part 2 - Working together

Everybody should be setup and comfortable with creating their own repositories on github and gitlab and make commits. In part 2, we want to actually work together
on a repository. If you want to know more details, please check:

* [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) (github)
* [Merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests) (gitlab)
* [Interactive course: Introduction to github](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)

## Tasks

* [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the main repository for this tutorial.
* [Clone the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) to your local computer.
* Create and checkout a new branch using `git checkout -b my-cool-feature`.
* Check using `git status`.
* Add a feature, e.g., add a source code file or change an existing one.
* Commit your changes using `git commit`
* Push the changes from your branch to a remote branch in your fork using `git push`.
* [Create a pull request from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on github and write a nice message to the maintainers.
